# Wedding Website Assets

## Envelope Intro Video

To add a video-based envelope opening animation like the reference site (boda-mar-jaume.lovable.app):

1. **Create or obtain an envelope opening video** showing:
   - A cream/ivory envelope with a red wax seal
   - The seal with "D & H" initials
   - The envelope opening animation
   - Transition to reveal the wedding content

2. **Name the video file**: `intro-video.mp4`

3. **Place it in this folder**: `/public/assets/intro-video.mp4`

4. **Recommended video specs**:
   - Resolution: 1920x1080 or higher
   - Format: MP4 (H.264 codec)
   - Duration: 3-5 seconds
   - File size: Under 5MB for fast loading

## Fallback Behavior

If no video is present, the website will display a beautiful static envelope with CSS animations:
- Cream/ivory textured envelope
- Red wax seal with "D & H" embossed
- Animated flap opening on click
- Smooth transition to main content

You can create the video using:
- **Canva**: Search for "envelope opening animation"
- **After Effects**: Create custom animation
- **Fiverr/Upwork**: Commission a motion designer
- **AI Video tools**: Runway, Pika, etc.
